Hello git and github, this is my git repository on my own computer
Wooo so in order to add text to a file use nano.
Alright so i kinda get it and have linked my gitHub to my local computer but 
im try to see if it automatically uploads on to github or if i have to 
manually do it every time 
Holy Jakers okay so firstly you say change the file, you then add it to the staging area, afterwhich you create your commit, and then you use git push and it will push your newly made changes to your gitHub 
so remember the command git push
